Project Overview:
This project’s goal is to help a real estate firm in New York City accurately estimate residential housing prices with the help of machine learning. The model uses property characteristics (size, age, building class, etc.) and location data to attempt to predict Sales Price. The primary business goal is to assist agents in setting competitive, data-driven, listing prices that will help reduce listing time on the market and improve the seller’s ROI.

BLUF:
The final model is a tuned XGBoost Regressor, trained on a dataset of over 20,000 cleaned NYC residential sales. After extensive feature engineering and external data enrichment, the model achieved:

R²: 0.594

MAE: $128,750

RMSE: $186,000

% of predictions within ±10% of actual price: 34.5%

Despite a wide range of geographic and economic features (Walk Score, crime proximity, distance to subway and Midtown), model performance plateaued near 60% R-squared. This suggests we are limited by the available data.

Data Usage Guide:
nyc-rolling-sales.csv: the raw data pulled from Kaggle. This is the core dataset before cleaning
cleaned_nyc_sales_with_walkscore.csv: This dataset incorporated walkscore and cleaned the iniital dataset
pluto_25v1_1.csv: Too large to upload to github. This is use dto extract precise lat/lon

Parks_Properties_20250616.csv: Sorted by zip code to calculate local park acerage
MTA_Subway_Entrances_and_Exits_2024.csv: this is used to compute proximity of properties to subways. *NOTE* this is from 2024 and our dataset is from 2016-17, so it may be slightly off.
NYPD_Complaint_Data_Historic_20250613.csv: Filtered by 2015-2016 crime to try to use crime as an indicator for sales price
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i/about_data (too large to upload to github. FILTER before downloading)
NYC_Household_Median_Income.csv: Used to see if median income by zip can be a predictor of sales price.
